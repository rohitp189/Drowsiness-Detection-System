# 🚗 Drowsiness Detection & Driver Management System

## 📌 About the Project  
Welcome to the **Drowsiness Detection & Driver Management System**, an AI-powered solution designed to ensure **road safety by detecting driver drowsiness in real-time**. This system helps prevent accidents caused by drowsy driving by providing immediate alerts to drivers and fleet managers.  

---

## 🌟 Why Choose Our System?  
Our system offers the following key benefits:  
✔ **Accurate AI Detection** – Monitors **eye closure**, **yawning**, and **head movements** for precise drowsiness detection.  
✔ **Real-Time Alerts** – Sends **instant warnings** to drivers to prevent accidents.  
✔ **Driver Management** – Tracks **driver activity** and ensures compliance with safety regulations.  

---

## 🌟 Key Features  
✔ **Real-Time Face & Eye Tracking** – Detects drowsiness using **facial landmark detection**.  
✔ **Advanced AI Models** – Uses **deep learning** for accurate drowsiness detection.  
✔ **Instant Alerts & Notifications** – Provides **audio-visual alarms** to wake up drivers in case of fatigue.  
✔ **Secure Data Management** – Stores data with **encryption** to meet safety compliance standards.  
✔ **Trip Monitoring** – Logs **trip data** and tracks **driver behavior** for safety audits.

## 🔍 How It Works?  
1️⃣ **Face Detection** – The system uses **OpenCV** and **Dlib** to identify the driver’s **facial landmarks**.  
2️⃣ **Drowsiness Calculation** – **Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR)** and **yawn detection** algorithms assess fatigue levels.  
3️⃣ **Alert System** – Triggers **audio-visual alarms** and **real-time notifications** to managers when drowsiness is detected.  
4️⃣ **Data Logging** – Logs driver activity and generates reports for **safety audits** and **analytics**.
